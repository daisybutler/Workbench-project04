# Workbench

Workbench is a membership website which provides remote workers with access to fully equipped workspaces in locations throughout the UK. Members can choose between two different subscription plans to suit their access requirements. One-off access to meeting rooms and office space can also be purchased by subscribers and non-subscribers.

The idea of this website was inspired by the shift from in-person to remote working for all office-based companies during the coronavirus pandemic. With the belief that this shift is here to stay, the option to access fully-equipped office environments on a flexible basis will only continue to grow in demand.

## UX

### Primary Goal

The primary goal of this website is to get users to sign up for a monthly subscription plan in return for access to workspaces throughout the UK. The website markets the services available to potential members and allows existing members to manage their subscription and schedule workspace bookings.

### User Profile

- ***The ideal user of this website is:***

    An individual who is working remotely on a full time or flexible basis in a job which mainly requires them to be seated at a desktop.

- ***Users of this website are looking to:***

    Access a fully-equipped workplace environment, in order to maximise their productivity and create a work/home life separation which working from home may not be facilitating for them.
- ***This website facilitates this for the user by providing:***

    Access to work-orientated environments on a subscription basis. Two types of subscription plans allows the user only pay for the access they need, which accomodates both full-time and part-time flexible workers.
