# Workbench

Workbench is a membership website which provides remote workers with access to fully equipped workspaces in locations throughout the UK. Members can choose between two different subscription plans to suit their access requirements. One-off access to meeting rooms and office space can also be purchased.

The concept of this website has been inspired by the enormous shift from office-based to remote working in many companies during the coronavirus pandemic. The option to access fully-equipped office environments on a flexible basis caters to a growing demand from both individuals and larger workforces, in order to maintain productivity in industries growing ever more remotely connected.
